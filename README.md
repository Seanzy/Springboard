# Springboard

#
Practicing with git

First clone the repo from website by copying the link of the repo and typing into command line: 
git clone https://github.com/Seanzy/Springboard.git

This will download the repo folder to your local computer in the directory that you typed the command in. 

Then change directory into that newly downloaded repo, in this case, the folder is named "Springboard".

Then modify a file inside, such as README.md and save. Now type:
git add readme.md or git add . to add everything

Then type git commit -m "commit message", with an appropriate message of your own

Then, if it's the first time pushing to this repo type

git push

After that you can type git push origin master or git push origin <branch>
